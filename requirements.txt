# Notes:
# - Installing `torch` via pip should follow the official instructions at https://pytorch.org
#   to select the correct wheel for your CUDA / CPU setup. Example for CPU-only Windows:
#     pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# - `whisper_timestamped` may require additional dependencies; if you hit errors, follow
#   the package documentation or install via its GitHub repository.
# - ffmpeg is required by pydub but is a system package (not a Python package). Install ffmpeg
#   on Windows via a package manager (choco/scoop) or from https://ffmpeg.org and add it to PATH.
